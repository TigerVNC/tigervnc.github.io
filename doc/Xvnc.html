<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Xvnc</b>
[<i>options</i>] :<i>display#</i></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><b>Xvnc</b></i>
is the X VNC (Virtual Network Computing) server. It is based
on a standard X server, but it has a &quot;virtual&quot;
screen rather than a physical one. X applications display
themselves on it as if it were a normal X display, but they
can only be accessed via a VNC viewer - see
<b>vncviewer</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So Xvnc is
really two servers in one. To the applications it is an X
server, and to the remote VNC users it is a VNC server. By
convention we have arranged that the VNC server display
number will be the same as the X server display number,
which means you can use eg. snoopy:2 to refer to display 2
on machine &quot;snoopy&quot; in both the X world and the
VNC world.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The best way of
starting <b>Xvnc</b> is via the <b>vncserver</b> script.
This sets up the environment appropriately and runs some X
applications to get you going. See the manual page for
<b>vncserver</b>(1) for more information.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Xvnc</b>
takes lots of options - running <b>Xvnc -help</b> gives a
list. Many of these are standard X server options, which are
described in the <b>Xserver</b>(1) manual page. In addition
to options which can only be set via the command-line, there
are also &quot;parameters&quot; which can be set both via
the command-line and through the <b>vncconfig</b>(1)
program. <b><br>
&minus;geometry</b> <i>width</i><b>x</b><i>height</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the size of the desktop
to be created. Default is 1024x768.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;depth</b>
<i>depth</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the pixel depth in bits
of the desktop to be created. Default is 24, other possible
values are 8, 15, and 16 - anything else is likely to cause
strange behaviour by applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;pixelformat</b>
<i>format</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify pixel format for server
to use (BGRnnn or RGBnnn). The default for depth 8 is BGR233
(meaning the most significant two bits represent blue, the
next three green, and the least significant three represent
red), the default for depth 16 is RGB565 and for depth 24 is
RGB888.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;interface</b> <i>IP
address</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Listen on interface. By default
Xvnc listens on all available interfaces.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">VNC parameters
can be set both via the command-line and through the
<b>vncconfig</b>(1) program, and with a VNC-enabled Xorg
server via Options entries in the xorg.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Parameters can
be turned on with -<i>param</i> or off with -<i>param</i>=0.
Parameters which take a value can be specified as -<i>param
value</i>. Other valid forms are
<i>param</i><b>=</b><i>value</i> -<i>param</i>=<i>value</i>
--<i>param</i>=<i>value</i>. Parameter names are
case-insensitive. <b><br>
&minus;desktop</b> <i>desktop-name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Each desktop has a name which
may be displayed by the viewer. It defaults to
&quot;x11&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;rfbport</b>
<i>port</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the TCP port on which
Xvnc listens for connections from viewers (the protocol used
in VNC is called RFB - &quot;remote framebuffer&quot;). The
default is 5900 plus the display number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;rfbwait</b>
<i>time</i><b>, &minus;ClientWaitTimeMillis</b>
<i>time</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Time in
milliseconds to wait for a viewer which is blocking Xvnc.
This is necessary because Xvnc is single-threaded and
sometimes blocks until the viewer has finished sending or
receiving a message - note that this does not mean an update
will be aborted after this time. Default is 20000 (20
seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;httpd</b>
<i>directory</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Run a mini-HTTP server which
serves files from the given directory. Normally the
directory will contain the classes for the Java viewer. In
addition, files with a .vnc extension will have certain
substitutions made so that a single installation of the Java
VNC viewer can be served by separate instances of Xvnc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;httpPort</b>
<i>port</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the port on which the
mini-HTTP server runs. Default is 5800 plus the display
number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;rfbauth</b>
<i>passwd-file</i><b>, &minus;PasswordFile</b>
<i>passwd-file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the file containing
the password used to authenticate viewers. The file is
accessed each time a connection comes in, so it can be
changed on the fly via <b>vncpasswd</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;DeferUpdate</b>
<i>time</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Xvnc uses a &quot;deferred
update&quot; mechanism which enhances performance in many
cases. After any change to the framebuffer, Xvnc waits for
this number of milliseconds (default 1) before sending an
update to any waiting clients. This means that more changes
tend to get coalesced together in a single update. Setting
it to 0 results in the same behaviour as earlier versions of
Xvnc, where the first change to the framebuffer causes an
immediate update to any waiting clients.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;AlwaysSetDeferUpdateTimer</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Keep delaying sending the
screen update to the client(s) each time the screen is
updated. Otherwise the delay is from the first update.
Default is off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;SendCutText</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Send clipboard changes to
clients (default is on). Note that you must also run
<b>vncconfig</b>(1) to get the clipboard to work.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;AcceptCutText</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Accept clipboard updates from
clients (default is on). Note that you must also run
<b>vncconfig</b>(1) to get the clipboard to work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;MaxCutText</b>
<i>bytes</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The maximum size of a clipboard
update that will be accepted from a client. Default is
<b>262144</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;AcceptPointerEvents</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Accept pointer press and
release events from clients (default is on).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;AcceptKeyEvents</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Accept key press and release
events from clients (default is on).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;DisconnectClients</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disconnect existing clients if
an incoming connection is non-shared (default is on). If
<b>DisconnectClients</b> is false, then a new non-shared
connection will be refused while there is a client active.
When combined with <b>NeverShared</b> this means only one
client is allowed at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;NeverShared</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Never treat incoming
connections as shared, regardless of the client-specified
setting (default is off).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;AlwaysShared</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Always treat incoming
connections as shared, regardless of the client-specified
setting (default is off).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Protocol3.3</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Always use protocol version 3.3
for backwards compatibility with badly-behaved clients
(default is off).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;CompareFB</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Perform pixel comparison on
framebuffer to reduce unnecessary updates (default is
on).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;ZlibLevel</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Zlib compression level for ZRLE
encoding (it does not affect Tight encoding). Acceptable
values are between 0 and 9. Default is to use the standard
compression level provided by the <b>zlib</b>(3) compression
library.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;ImprovedHextile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use improved compression
algorithm for Hextile encoding which achieves better
compression ratios by the cost of using slightly more CPU
time. Default is on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;SecurityTypes</b>
<i>sec-types</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify which security scheme
to use for incoming connections. Valid values are a comma
separated list of <b>None</b>, <b>VncAuth</b>, <b>Plain</b>,
<b>TLSNone</b>, <b>TLSVnc</b>, <b>TLSPlain</b>,
<b>X509None</b>, <b>X509Vnc</b> and <b>X509Plain</b>.
Default is <b>VncAuth,TLSVnc</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Password</b>
<i>password</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Obfuscated binary encoding of
the password which clients must supply to access the server.
Using this parameter is insecure, use <b>PasswordFile</b>
parameter instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;PlainUsers</b>
<i>user-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A comma separated list of user
names that are allowed to authenticate via any of the
&quot;Plain&quot; security types (Plain, TLSPlain, etc.).
Specify <b>*</b> to allow any user to authenticate using
this security type. Default is to deny all users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;pam_service</b>
<i>name</i><b>, &minus;PAMService</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">PAM service name to use when
authentication users using any of the &quot;Plain&quot;
security types. Default is <b>vnc</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;X509Cert</b>
<i>path</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path to a X509 certificate in
PEM format to be used for all X509 based security types
(X509None, X509Vnc, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;X509Key</b>
<i>path</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Private key counter part to the
certificate given in <b>X509Cert</b>. Must also be in PEM
format.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;BlacklistThreshold</b>
<i>count</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of unauthenticated
connection attempts allowed from any individual host before
that host is black-listed. Default is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;BlacklistTimeout</b>
<i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The initial timeout applied
when a host is first black-listed. The host cannot
re-attempt a connection until the timeout expires. Default
is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;IdleTimeout</b>
<i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of seconds after
which an idle VNC connection will be dropped (default is 0,
which means that idle connections will never be
dropped).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;MaxDisconnectionTime</b>
<i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Terminate when no client has
been connected for <i>N</i> seconds. Default is 0.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;MaxConnectionTime</b>
<i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Terminate when a client has
been connected for <i>N</i> seconds. Default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;MaxIdleTime</b>
<i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Terminate after <i>N</i>
seconds of user inactivity. Default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;QueryConnect</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prompts the user of the desktop
to explicitly accept or reject incoming connections. This is
most useful when using the vnc.so module or
<b>x0vncserver</b>(1) program to access an existing X
desktop via VNC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>vncconfig</b>(1) program must be running on the desktop
in order for QueryConnect to be supported by the
<b>vnc.so</b>(1) module or <b>Xvnc</b>(1) program. The
<b>x0vncserver</b>(1) program does not require
<b>vncconfig</b>(1) to be running.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;QueryConnectTimeout</b>
<i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of seconds to show the
Accept Connection dialog before rejecting the connection.
Default is <b>10</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;localhost</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Only allow connections from the
same machine. Useful if you use SSH and want to stop non-SSH
connections from any other hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Log</b>
<i>logname</i><b>:</b><i>dest</i><b>:</b><i>level</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Configures the debug log
settings. <i>dest</i> can currently be <b>stderr</b>,
<b>stdout</b> or <b>syslog</b>, and <i>level</i> is between
0 and 100, 100 meaning most verbose output. <i>logname</i>
is usually <b>*</b> meaning all, but you can target a
specific source file if you know the name of its
&quot;LogWriter&quot;. Default is <b>*:stderr:30</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;RemapKeys</b>
<i>mapping</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets up a keyboard mapping.
<i>mapping</i> is a comma-separated string of character
mappings, each of the form <i>char</i>-&gt;<i>char</i>, or
<i>char</i>&lt;&gt;<i>char</i>, where <i>char</i> is a
hexadecimal keysym. For example, to exchange the &quot; and
@ symbols you would specify the following:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="26%"></td>
<td width="31%">


<p>RemapKeys=0x22&lt;&gt;0x40</p></td>
<td width="43%">
</td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;AvoidShiftNumLock</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Key affected by NumLock often
require a fake Shift to be inserted in order for the correct
symbol to be generated. Turning on this option avoids these
extra fake Shift events but may result in a slightly
different symbol (e.g. a Return instead of a keypad
Enter).</p>

<h2>USAGE WITH INETD
<a name="USAGE WITH INETD"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By configuring
the <b>inetd</b>(1) service appropriately, Xvnc can be
launched on demand when a connection comes in, rather than
having to be started manually. When given the <b>-inetd</b>
option, instead of listening for TCP connections on a given
port it uses its standard input and standard output. There
are two modes controlled by the wait/nowait entry in the
inetd.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the nowait
mode, Xvnc uses its standard input and output directly as
the connection to a viewer. It never has a listening socket,
so cannot accept further connections from viewers (it can
however connect out to listening viewers by use of the
vncconfig program). Further viewer connections to the same
TCP port result in inetd spawning off a new Xvnc to deal
with each connection. When the connection to the viewer
dies, the Xvnc and any associated X clients die. This
behaviour is most useful when combined with the XDMCP
options -query and -once. An typical example in inetd.conf
might be (all on one line):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">5950 stream tcp
nowait nobody /usr/local/bin/Xvnc Xvnc -inetd -query
localhost -once securitytypes=none</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this example
a viewer connection to :50 will result in a new Xvnc for
that connection which should display the standard XDM login
screen on that machine. Because the user needs to login via
XDM, it is usually OK to accept connections without a VNC
password in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the wait
mode, when the first connection comes in, inetd gives the
listening socket to Xvnc. This means that for a given TCP
port, there is only ever one Xvnc at a time. Further viewer
connections to the same port are accepted by the same Xvnc
in the normal way. Even when the original connection is
broken, the Xvnc will continue to run. If this is used with
the XDMCP options -query and -once, the Xvnc and associated
X clients will die when the user logs out of the X session
in the normal way. It is important to use a VNC password in
this case. A typical entry in inetd.conf might be:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">5951 stream tcp
wait james /usr/local/bin/Xvnc Xvnc -inetd -query localhost
-once passwordFile=/home/james/.vnc/passwd</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In fact
typically, you would have one entry for each user who uses
VNC regularly, each of whom has their own dedicated TCP port
which they use. In this example, when user &quot;james&quot;
connects to :51, he enters his VNC password, then gets the
XDM login screen where he logs in in the normal way.
However, unlike the previous example, if he disconnects, the
session remains persistent, and when he reconnects he will
get the same session back again. When he logs out of the X
session, the Xvnc will die, but of course a new one will be
created automatically the next time he connects.</p>
